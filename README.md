[ex01](https://github.com/MikeBendorf11/C-Sharp-UW/tree/master/1_programmingInCS) from the first quarter [Programming in CS](https://www.pce.uw.edu/Overview/PROG/5905) is done. Input validation was achieved by using some of the `throw, try and catch` methods provided by Petzold

On my free time and by doing some research, I found it appears that `WPF and XAML` programming are the most useful parts of C# I can learn for now. So any additional time I have apart from completing my UW assignments should be dedicated to follow some [Microsoft tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application)

Following the links on this page, plus doing some experimentation with the provided classes will be good. So when the time comes to review the WPF at the UW I'll be fully prepared

Finished the book "DotNetBookZero11", uploaded learning notes to the wiki
and now I'm installing VS community 2015.

>LoL why would you need to do that from a bootable USB or DVD, if it's free?
