            Online students attend sessions using a Zoom Meeting Room, where they will meet in real-time with their instructor and classmates. Students will be able to participate via a 'chat' feature in the Meeting Room. Students will hear the instructor via their computer speakers and can respond/ask questions by typing in a chat field. Our TA will answer what question he can, and relay other questions or comments to the instructor.
